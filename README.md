# AI Healthcare Research and Writing Automation

This project leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and automated search tools to streamline the process of researching and writing about AI in healthcare. By integrating LangChain community tools and a sophisticated agent-based model, it aims to uncover groundbreaking technologies and narrate compelling stories around AI's impact on healthcare.

## Features

- **Automated Research**: Utilizes a senior researcher agent to conduct in-depth research on AI trends in healthcare, focusing on identifying pros, cons, and the overall narrative.
- **Content Creation**: Employs a writer agent to craft engaging and insightful articles on the latest AI advancements in healthcare, ensuring the content is accessible, engaging, and informative.
- **Sequential Task Execution**: Manages tasks in a sequential process, ensuring that research is completed before writing begins, to maintain coherence and relevance in the content produced.
- **Customizable Agents**: Both the researcher and writer agents are customizable, allowing for adjustments in goals, tools, and verbosity to suit different research and writing styles.
- **Integration with LangChain Community Tools**: Incorporates LangChain community tools like the DuckDuckGoSearchRun for efficient online research.
